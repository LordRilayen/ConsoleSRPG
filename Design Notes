Mechanics:
	Combat:
		On attacking, the damage dealt is determined by:
			Physical
				--(((Strength + Weapon Strength) + (Weapon Tier * Weapon Level))* (1 + Weapon Proficiency/100)) - Target's Defense
				--if Critical, + Critical Bonus
				--if Elemental, a second round of damage is dealt
					-- ((Personal Elemental Damage + Weapon Elemental Damage) * (1 + Weapon/Proficiency/100)) - Target's Elemental Resistance
			Magical
				--(((Intelligence + Weapon Intelligence) + (Spell Tier * Spell Level)) * (1 + Weapon Proficiency/100)) - Target's Resistance
				--if Critical, + Critical Bonus
				--if Elemental, a second round of damage is dealt
				  -- (((Personal Elemental Damage + Spell Elemental Damage) + (Spell Tier * Spell Level)) * (1 + Weapon Proficiency/100)) - Target's Resistance
	Level Generation:
		Every map has an assigned Difficulty level, starting at 1 and increasing (theoretically) infinitely
		Every map will have a pseudorandom number of enemies based on the size of the map.
			We take the total size of the map and cut it in half. Get a random number between 1 and that value. Hold onto this value.
			We take that value and cut it in half again, and again take a random number between 1 and the new value. Hold onto this value.
			"Flip a coin." Heads we add the values, tails we subtract the second one.
			"Flip another coin." Heads we add 2, tails we subtract 2.

			Ex:
				8x8 Map.
				64 squares -> random number between 1-32 -> 3 -> random number between 1 - 3 -> 3 -> "tails" -> 3 - 3 = 0 -> "heads" -> 0 + 2 = 2: The map will have 2 enemies
				64 squares -> random number between 1-32 -> 26 -> random number between 1 - 13 -> 3 -> "tails" -> 26 - 3 = 23 -> "tails" -> 23 - 2 = 21: The map will have 21 enemies
				64 squares -> random number between 1-32 -> 17 -> random number between 1 - 13 -> 1 -> "heads" -> 17 + 1 = 23 -> "tails" -> 17 - 2 = 15: The map will have 15 enemies
		Every map will have a "Deployment Zone"
			A particular square will be designated the "center," and the Player will be allowed to deploy as many characters as they wish within 4 squares at the start of a battle
